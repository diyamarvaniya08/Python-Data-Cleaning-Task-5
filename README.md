# Python-Data-Cleaning-Task-5
This project is part of Data Analysis Internship – Task 5. The objective is to perform  data cleaning, preprocessing, and basic analysis on the Titanic dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

# Dataset Used
- Dataset Name: Titanic_test.csv
- Source: Kaggle (Titanic Dataset)
- Tool Used: Jupyter Notebook (Python,Pandas)

# Steps Performed
  # 1️. Data Loading
- Loaded the Titanic dataset into Jupyter Notebook using Pandas.
- Verified dataset structure and columns.

 # 2️. Data Exploration
- Checked dataset shape, column names, and data types.
- Identified missing values and irrelevant columns.

 # 3. Data Cleaning
- Filled missing values in Age column using median.
- Removed unnecessary or highly missing columns (like Cabin when not available).
- Handled warnings related to chained assignment properly.

 # 4. Data Preprocessing
- Converted categorical columns into suitable formats.
- Ensured numerical columns were clean and consistent.

 # 5️. Analysis & Insights
- Prepared clean data for further analysis or modeling.
  
# 6. Key Insights
- Missing values were mostly present in Age-related data.
- Proper preprocessing improves dataset usability.
- Cleaned dataset is suitable for further ML or visualization tasks.

# 7. Conclusion
This task demonstrates:
- Practical data cleaning skills
- Understanding of real-world dataset issues
- Ability to work with Jupyter Notebook and Pandas
